Pizza Parlour Data Analysis

    Project Overview:
            This project analyzes sales, customer preferences, and revenue data for
                a Pizza Parlour using SQL queries.
            The data is stored across four main tables: Pizzas, Pizza Types, Orders,
                and Order Details. By using SQL queries,
            we derive insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and
                revenue distribution. These insights can help optimize pricing,
                inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer experience.

    Project Contents:
            SQL Scripts: A collection of SQL queries that are used to answer various busines
                s questions related to pizza sales and customer behavior.
            PowerPoint Presentation: A slide deck summarizing the key insights and observations
                from the data analysis.

    Database Structure
        The project involves four main tables in the database:

    Tools and Technologies
            SQL: Used for querying the database and extracting insights.

    Key SQL Queries
        Here are some of the SQL queries used in the project:

    Basic Queries:
        Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
        Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
        Identify the highest-priced pizza.
        Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
        List the top 5 most ordered pizza types with their quantities.
    Intermediate Queries:

        Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
        Find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
        Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
        Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
    Advanced Queries:
        Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
        Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
        Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
